Hello,  asdfasfdafdsadsf
This is a demo of the circuit lab. It is intended to model how a digital lab might be constructed. This is a technical demo. It is NOT intended to replace current lab material.  This demo is a foundation for which future labs might be built.

Hint:
+ Left click to access circuit element properties. 
+ OR two finger click to access properties.
+ Circuit elements can be rotated using property's panel or on grid.
  Hover mouse over far edge of element until you see an empty rectangle. 
  Click and hold to rotate.

Introduction:
Circuits are the way with which we make electricity do useful things. And it is through the study of circuits, that we are able to produce the tools we use today. In 1827 Ohm published "The Galvanic Circuit Studied Mathematically", which experimentally established the relationship between current, I, and potential difference, V. You will verify these relationships.

Current and Voltage:
Ascertain the relationship between current, voltage. Set up a simple circuit as shown below. Given a simple circuit measure the current for the following set of voltages.
[-2.0, -1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
