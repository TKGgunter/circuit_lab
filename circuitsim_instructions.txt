NOTE: This README is for instructors. It contains information that 
would allows students to spoil themselfs, solutions to side panel questions 
and uncertainties for custom elements.

*****UPATED(02/09/21)*****
Tab is now used to exit teacher mode.
Custom voltmeter/ammeter were added to simulation.
Dll support instructions for windows users.


*****UPATED(01/28/21)*****
TA.txt must be added to the directory of the app to access ta mode.

*****UPATED(01/08/21)*****
Advanced users new functionality has been added. Check the advanced section for details.


Introduction:
This package contains a circuit simulation program usable on Windows, MacOs and Linux machines.
The simulation is intended to be used by TAs, professors and students.
The following is a set of instructions intended to help on board instructors.


General Warning:
This program is near release, there maybe bugs that need to be swashed and features
to be polished. If bugs are found please contact the developer at the address linked above.
Be mindful of the additional files in the unzipped directory. 
Some of these files maybe needed to generate side panels and circuit element panels. 
If you use Linux, Terminal will be needed to configure the executable file.
If you use MacOs you may need to use Terminal to configure the executable file.



Windows:
Windows user should double click application file "lab_sims_windows.exe". 
Windows may ask you to verify that the application comes from a trusted source.
You must agree to this for the program to run. If you are not able to run the 
program and recieve a missing dll error. Search the dll folder provided for said 
dll and copy/move the file from the dll folder to the folder containing the executable.
If this does not work please contact the current package maintaner. 


MacOs: ***UPDATED(12/18/2020)*****
MacOs users should double click the file named "CircuitSim".
The icon for this file is a set of circles, this is a temporary icon.
By double clicking this file MacOS may warn you about the program being untrust worthy.
To by pass this control click control click and press open. MacOS may warn you again
but should give you the option to ignore. Ignore the warnings and the application should open.
If the program does not open you may need to changes the executables permissions.
To do this you will need to use the program Terminal. 
Navigate using 'cd' into the directory labelled 'CircuitSim.app/MacOS' and use chmod
to change the permissions of 'xcopyfgc'. If you do not understand these directions contact
the package maintainer. 


Linux: 
Linux users will need to set execution permissions and run the program from the terminal.
Begin my navigating to the correct directory. If you have not moved the files since you 
it unzipped you should find the program at "Downloads/circuit_sim/".
Navigate here using the following command "cd Downloads/circuit_sim/"
To set executable permission by running "chmod 744 lab_sims_linux". 
To run circuit sim "./lab_sims_linux"


Bugs and Issues:
If you encounter an issue with the simulation's results, like the circuit delivering 
incorrect voltages, please save a circuit copy of the circuit and email it to me with
 a description of the problem. If you experience a crash please send an email detailing what you did before the crash.
If you are able to reproduce the crash please try and include a description of the steps 
you went through.


Advanced users:
This program is to be used by both students and TAs/professors. As such there is a teacher mode.
To enter TA mode save an empty file named "TA.txt" in the directory of the program.
By pressing 'Tab' you enter TA mode. Press 'Tab' to exit TA mode.
You will not be able to enter TA mode with "TA.txt" file.
When 'Tab' is pressed "circuit_panels.txt" is written in the directory of the executable.
By altering "circuit_panels.txt" one can alter the text displayed in the panel on  
right side of the screen. Please use "circuit_panels.txt" as a template when altering the panel.
By pressing 'Tab' a binary verion of "circuit_panels.txt" will be created with the file extention ".exp".


===========================================
Below are the current key words needed when working working in TA mode 
(Keywords are indifferent to case.):
#Section    Creates a new empty page

#Header     Renders text in a bold font. Text can begin on the same line.

#Text       Renders text that follows the command. Text can begin on the same line. If this command 
            is not invoked no text will be displayed.

#Image      Renders image in panel. Give local path (path from the directory of executable). 
            If path is incorrect the program will render nothing.

#Question   Renders following text and primes program to receive #AnswerCorrect, and #AnswerWrong.
            If followed by command that is not #AnswerCorrect or #AnswerWrong, 
            nothing will render.

#AnswerCorrect  Renders the text that follows. This will not render if #Question is not the 
#AnswerWrong    proceeding command. Only 7 answers are allowed. If there is no correct answer neither 
                the question or answers are rendered.

//          Comments can be written using double back slashes.
===========================================

NOTE:
Errors associated with teacher mode are printed in a banner at the bottom of the application window. 
If you perceive an error, but no error message was delivered please contact the current package mantainer.

When exiting teacher mode "circuit_worksheet.exp" is save in the same directory.
This file is a binary version of the text file, meant to hide any answers from students.
If this file will load upon start up of the program, the text file will not.
The text file may be over written when changing to teacher mode, be mindful.


Advanced users can author custom circuit elements. While in TA mode navigate to the 'Custom' tag. 
Once there notice the red save button at the bottom of the circuit element menu. If an element is
clicked while in TA mode you can change the properties of that class of element. Users should note
that any combination of properties can be constructed and there is no guarantee obscure combinations will 
behave properly. 

When using custom elements think of the circuit element menu as a factory creating circuit parts. 
Resistance, voltage, capacitance,inductance, charge and flux are all properties that can be changed. 
The uncertainty on the property can be defined here as well. Using the model of a factory uncertainty 
dictates the variance of the property element by element. Meaning if you set the uncertainty of the resistance to 0.1
with a resistance of 1.00.  Element 1 might have a resistance of 0.99, while element two a resistance 
of 1.05.

In addition to bias and noise instructor can also augment the nominal value of custom ammeters and 
voltmeters with a 'drift' term. 'Drift' can be thought of as a correlation term. When 'Drift' is 
1 measurements delivered from voltmeter/ammeter are total uncorrelated with the values from the 
simulation. In this case measurements can drift where they please, as dictated by the noise.
When 'drift' is 0 measured values are fully correlated with the values from the simulation, there
is no 'drift'.  The equation for measurements using custom voltmeter/ammeter are as follows:

drift :=  d 
noise := std
bias  := bias
Gaussian sample := sample_normal()
previous_measurement := p_m   <= this is after augmentations
measurement from simulation := m

Measurement displayed by custom voltmeter/ammeter: 
d * p_m + (1-d) * (m + b) + sample_normal( std )
