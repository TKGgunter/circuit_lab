This package contains a circuit simulation program usable on Windows, MacOs and Linux machines.
The simulation is intended to be a technical demo for future circuit labs.  The following is a set of 
instructions intended to help on board beta users.


General Warning:
This program is in beta, there are bugs that need to be swashed and features
to be added. Do not move executables. Additional files are needed for 
program to run which are unpacked along with the executable. 
If you use MacOs or Linux Terminal will be needed to configure the executable file.
One MacOs you can access terminal using Launchpad, should see its icon, a little
rocket ship, on the dock at the bottom of your desktop. Type "Terminal" in the 
search bar and the program should pop up. 

Both MacOs and Linux users have access to the same terminal commands. Before
continuing on to you sections you will need to navigate the terminal program to 
the appropriate directory. Assuming you have not moved the extracted zip file
you can use the following command to move to the appropriate folder, "cd ~/Downloads/lab_sims".


Windows:
Windows user should double click application file "lab_sims_windows.exe". 
Windows may ask you to verify that the application comes from a trusted source.
You must agree to this for the program to run.


MacOs:
MacOs users will note that the file is shown to be a text file. 
To run you must change the files executable permissions.
In the terminal run "chmod 744 lab_sims_macos". This will allow only 
the user to execute the program. MacOS may remind you that this 
program did not come from a verified source. You may need to to navigate 
through the “System Preferences” -> “Security and Privacy” -> 
“General” sub menus and select “Allow apps downloaded from anywhere.”. 
Otherwise select "Open".


Linux: 
Linux users will need to set execution permissions and run the program from the terminal.
To set executable permission run "chmod 744 lab_sims_linux". 
To run circuit sim "./lab_sims_linux"


Bugs and Issues:
If you encounter an issue with the simulation's results, like the circuit delivering 
incorrect voltages, please save a circuit copy of the circuit and email it to me with
 a description of the problem. If you experience a crash please send an email detailing what you did before the crash.
If you are able to reproduce the crash please try and include a description of the steps 
you went through.

Here is a list of the few known bugs:
+ when a circuit elements is place on top of one another the simulation 
will crash or perform improperly.
+ if there are many paths to and from the oldest placed circuit element the program may get 
confused. And a path may not be taken or the simulation will refuse to run (there will be no
current or voltage calculation.)

If you encounter the second bug please send me a copy of the save file and 
a description of what went wrong.


Advanced users:
This program is to be used by both students and TAs/professors. As such there is a teacher mode.
By pressing 'Tab' you enter TA mode. Press 'Space' to exit TA mode.
When 'Tab' is pressed "circuit_panels.txt" is written in the directory of the executable.
By altering "circuit_panels.txt" one can alter the text displayed in the panel on  
right side of the screen. Please use "circuit_panels.txt" as a template when altering the panel.


===========================================
Below are the current key words needed when working working in TA mode 
(all keywords are indifferent to case):
#Section    This creates a new empty page

#Text       Renders text that follows the command. Text can begin on the same line. If this command 
            is not invoked no text will be displayed.

#Image      Renders image in panel. Give local path (path from the directory of executable). 
            If path is incorrect the program will render nothing.

#Question   Renders following text and primes program to receive #AnswerCorrect, and #AnswerWrong.
            If followed by command that is not #AnswerCorrect or #AnswerWrong, 
            nothing will render.

#AnswerCorrect  Renders the text that follows. This will not render if #Question is not the 
#AnswerWrong    proceeding command. Only 7 answers are allowed. If there is no correct answer neither 
                the question or answers are rendered.

//          Comments can be written using double back slashes.
===========================================

NOTE:
Often errors associated with teacher mode are printed in your terminal.

When exiting teacher mode "circuit_worksheet.exp" is save in the same directory.
This file is a binary version of the text file, meant to hide any answers from students.
If this file will load upon start up of the program, the text file will not.

UPDATE:
The text file WILL NOT BE over written when changing to teacher mode, be mindful.
